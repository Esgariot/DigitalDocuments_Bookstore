# DigitalDocuments_Bookstore
Student project for Digital Documents (2018)


- __Project management is in "Project" tab, go take a look and pick a task.__
- issues and pull requests will automatically move to different columns on our board
  - using keyword in pull request will handle referenced items (https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/)
  - creating pull request moves task to "Needs review", accepting review moves to "accepted", and merging moves to "Done". All automatically :)
